INFO:root:Session ID: 111, AI Response: The context provided does not include specific information about check-in bags. However, generally speaking, check-in bags, also known as checked luggage, are larger pieces of luggage that passengers hand over to the airline at the check-in counter or at the gate before boarding the aircraft. Here are some common points about check-in bags:

1. **Size and Weight Limits**: Airlines typically have size and weight restrictions for checked bags. Exceeding these limits may result in additional fees.

2. **Checked Bag Fees**: Many airlines charge fees for checked luggage, especially for the first or second bag. It’s important to check your airline’s policy.

3. **Baggage Claim**: After the flight, checked bags are picked up at the baggage claim area in the airport.

4. **Security Regulations**: Items that are restricted in carry-on bags may be allowed in checked bags, but it’s still important to check with the airline and TSA guidelines.

5. **Labeling**: It’s advisable to label your checked bags with your name and contact information in case they get lost.

For specific details about check-in bags, it is best to refer to your airline's policies or the airport's guidelines.
